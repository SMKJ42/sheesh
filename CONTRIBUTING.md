TODO's

-   Create feature flags for different harnesses in Cargo.toml
-   OAuth2.0? Would require seperating auth_tokens and refresh_tokens into seperate servers, and implementing communication between the two.
-   Remove dependency on connection for each harness, is there a way to pass the connection between the different harness?
